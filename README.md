# Cancer research analysis

In this Cancer research, 249 mice over a period of 45 days were being tested on and we observed the advantage of different drug regimens and their effectiveness in reducing tomur sizes in mice. 
In the analysis, data cleaning, statistical summaries, visualizations, and linear regression method were used to compare the performance of Capomulin drug regimens against other treatment regimens. 
We used data cleaning to identify duplicate items and remove them to better analyse the data. 
In summary statistic, mean median and variance of different drug regimens were illustrated.

Gender distribution was demonstrated with the pie chart and according to pie chart 50.9 % men and 49.1 % women mice were being tested in the research. 
Furthermore, four drug regimens - Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin - were selected for focused analysis to navigate the distribution of the final tumor volume for all the mice in each treatment group. 
Lastly linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot was generated and positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume was illustrated. 
Jupyter environment was used to open Jupyter Notebook file.
